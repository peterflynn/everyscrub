Everyscrub for Brackets
=======================
Everything's a scrubber! Cmd/Ctrl + drag on any number or hex color to scrub its value. In "Live development" mode, the browser
preview will update in real time while you're dragging.

You can also tap Shift+Alt+Up/Down to "nudge" the value in individual increments.

Works with any number in CSS, LESS, SVG, HTML and JavaScript. Also works with 3- or 6-digit hex colors (darkens/lightens the
color). Just hold down Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Win), mouse down on the number in your source code, and drag the mouse horizontally.
